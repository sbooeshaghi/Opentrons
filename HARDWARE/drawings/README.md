## Drawings
In this folder some technical drawings are included. The drawings are presented in md-files and linked to a google drawing. By clicking on the drawing you get referred to the original google drawing which is drawn in the right dimensions.

* `Slots.md` contains a representation of the robot deck
* `96 wells.md` is a drawing of a 96 wells plate

Furthermore, this folder contains 2 subfolders which represent suggested designs for labware to deck attachment. *I made these designs because I wanted to optimize the immobility of the labware which is critical for a good calibration and therefore indispensible for efficient work with the labrobot in general.*
