## HARDWARE

The `HARDWARE` folder is mainly focussed on the firm attachment of labware to the robot which is required for a good calibration and therefore indispensible for efficient work with the robot.
There are 2 subfolders:
* `drawings`: In this folder some technical drawings of the robot-deck and common containers are included. The drawings are presented in md-files and linked to a google drawing with the right dimensions. Furthermore, 2 possible designs for labware to deck attachment are presented.
* `stl files`: This folder contains stl files for the 3D printing of additional pieces to attach labware firmly to the robot.
