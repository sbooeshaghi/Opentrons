## Protocols

This folder contains 3 protocols:
* `Split pool barcoding protocol.py`: This protocol was made as a first attempt to implement split pool barcoding. A diagram of the robot's movements is included in the folder.

* `example_protocol.py` ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IdHP-5DXYBkbdMaAbL4stZ4RvGIAhJ0E/view?usp=sharing)): This protocol shows how to displace a the fluid of one row into another row on a 96-wells plate. It is a very simple operation. A diagram of the robot's movements is included in the folder. The protocol is used to illustrate the principles of creating a protocol in the main `README.md`.  

* `refill.py` ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NyLzNw02rCrPFUXSi67Vc6YS1a4g1PVH/view?usp=sharing)): to run the example protocol, the first row of a 96-wells plate needs to be full. This protocol can take care of that. A diagram of the robot's movements is included in the folder.

Furthermore, a jupyter notebook, `Notebook: Split pool barcoding protocol.pynb`, illustrates in an interactive manner how to create a protocol (as an alternative to the explanation in the main `README.md`.
